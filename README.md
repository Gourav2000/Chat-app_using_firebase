<h2>Important Note</h2>
<b><i>At the time i made the project the android studio vesrion was 3.3.2 , so when you import it in later versions in android studio it might mark some files as unrecognizable, to solve this
make sure to make your project compatible with android x and legacy artifacts and you are good to go. ;-)</i></b>
