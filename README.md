# Chat appplication for android using firebase
This is a basic chat app for android made using firebase

<h2>Getting started</h2>
To get it working for you need to create a account in firebase console by linking it with your google account, you are good to go if u have one already else you might have to create one. Create a project and link your android app with
firebase by copying your google-services.json file from firebse and place it in the app directory of the project.
<br><br>
<h2>It uses 3 features of firebase</h2>
<li>Firebase<b> Realtime database</b></li>
<li>Firebase <b>Authentication</b></li>
<li>Firebase <b>Storage</b></li>
<br><br>
In order to authenticate the users registering on the platform, make sure to enable the email sign-in checkbox in firebase authentication in firebase console.
<h2>Important Note</h2>
<b><i>When I made the project, the android studio vesrion was 3.3.2 , and hence, when you import it in the newer versions of android studio, it might mark some files as unrecognizable and to solve this
make sure you make your project compatible with android x and legacy artifacts. And then you are good to go. ;-)</i></b>
